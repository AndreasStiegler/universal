Flow Manager
===

The flow manager is responsible for the overall orchestration of the various subcomponents which comprise the GPII personalization architecture. It:

- is able to be notified by the user listener.
- queries the preferences server for user preferences.
- queries the solutions reporter for available solutions.
- communicates with the matchmaker.
- communicates with the launch manager.

---
Calls to the preferences server are made with user credentials. 

### Dependencies

- [express](http://expressjs.com/) framework.
- [infusion](https://github.com/fluid-project/infusion) framework.

### Run

To test the flow manager independently, please use testDriver module within universal repository. Simply run (from universal root):

    node gpii/node_modules/testDriver/src/TestDriver.js
    
Note that the overall "universal" root repository must itself appear in the node modules lookup path. This can most easily be achieved by checking it out into a directory named "node_modules" at the higher level.
