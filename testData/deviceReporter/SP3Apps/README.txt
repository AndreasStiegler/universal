testData/deviceReporter/SP3Apps folder
============================================

This directory contains json files, with content that is compatible to be used as a device-reporter.

The files in this folder each represent an application that is integrated with the GPII. The purpose
of having this folder is:

1) Having an easy reference to solution IDs of the SP3 applications, in case one wants to modify the
installedSolutions.json file with new SP3 applications.
2) The ability to easily insert the full content of one of these files into installedSolutions.json,
in case one wants to test/set up the system with a single solution reported.
